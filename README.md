# Flower_Classification using Tensorflow
This is a flower classification project using convolutional neural network. This project can classify five types of flower images which are Tulip, Daisy, Roses, Sunflowers and Dadelion with a accuracy of 73% after 15 epochs. There are 3670 flower images which are divided into five subfloders according to the name of their class.
